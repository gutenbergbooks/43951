      PREFACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      With reference to certain actual and possible questions of priority and
      originality, it may be explained that this Word Book was begun in the San
      Francisco "Wasp" in the year 1881, and has been continued, in a desultory
      way, in several journals and periodicals. As it was no part of the
      author's purpose to define all the words in the language, or even to make
      a complete alphabetical series, the stopping-place of the book was
      determined by considerations of bulk. In the event of this volume proving
      acceptable to that part of the reading public to which in humility it is
      addressed&mdash;enlightened souls who prefer dry wines to sweet, sense to
      sentiment, good English to slang, and wit to humor&mdash;there may
      possibly be another if the author be spared for the compiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conspicuous, and it is hoped not unpleasing, feature of the book is its
      abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets, chief of whom is that
      learned and ingenious cleric, Father Gassalasca Jape, S. J., whose lines
      bear his initials. To Father Jape's kindly encouragement and assistance
      the author of the prose text is greatly indebted.

    <p>
      ABASEMENT, n. A decent and customary mental attitude in the presence of
      wealth or power. Peculiarly appropriate in an employé when addressing an
      employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABATIS, n. Rubbish in front of a fort, to prevent the rubbish outside from
      molesting the rubbish inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABDICATION, n. An act whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the high
      temperature of the throne.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Poor Isabella's dead, whose abdication
     Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation.
     For that performance 'twere unfair to scold her:
     She wisely left a throne too hot to hold her.
     To History she 'll be no royal riddle&mdash;
     Merely a plain parched pea that jumped the griddle.
</pre>
    <p>
      ABDOMEN, n. The temple of the god Stomach, in whose worship, with
      sacrificial rights, all true men engage. From women this ancient faith
      commands but a stammering assent. They sometimes minister at the altar in
      a half-hearted and inefficient way, but true reverence for the one deity
      that men really adore they know not. If woman had a free hand in the
      world's marketing the race would become graminivorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABILITY, n. The natural equipment to accomplish some small part of the
      meaner ambitions distinguishing able men from dead ones. In the last
      analysis ability is commonly found to consist mainly in a high degree of
      solemnity. Perhaps, however, this impressive quality is rightly appraised;
      it is no easy task to be solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABNORMAL, adj. Not conforming to standard. In matters of thought and
      conduct, to be independent is to be abnormal, to be abnormal is to be
      detested. Wherefore the lexicographer adviseth a striving toward a
      straiter resemblance to the Average Man than he hath to himself. Who so
      attaineth thereto shall have peace, the prospect of death and the hope of
      Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABORIGINES, Persons of little worth found cumbering the soil of a newly
      discovered country. They soon cease to cumber; they fertilize.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABRACADABRA.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     By Abracadabra we signify
     An infinite number of things.
     'T is the answer to What? and How? and Why?
     And Whence? and Whither?&mdash;a word whereby
     The Truth (with the comfort it brings)
     Is open to all who grope in night,
     Crying for Wisdom's holy light.

     Whether the word is a verb or a noun
     Is knowledge beyond my reach.
     I only know that't is handed down
     From sage to sage,
     From age to age&mdash;
     An immortal part of speech!

     Of an ancient man the tale is told
     That he lived to be ten centuries old,
     In a cave on a mountain side.
     (True, he finally died.)
     The fame of his wisdom filled the land,
     For his head was bald and you 'll understand
     His beard was long and white
     And his eyes uncommonly bright.

     Philosophers gathered from far and near
     To sit at his feet and hear and hear,
     Though he never was heard
     To utter a word
     But "Abracadabra, abracadab,
     Abracada, abracad.
     Abraca, abrac, ahra, ab!"
     'T was all he had,
     'T was all they wanted to hear, for each
     Made copious notes of the mystical speech
     Which they published next&mdash;
     A trickle of text
     In a meadow of commentary.
     Mighty big books were these,
     In number, as leaves of trees;
     In learning, remarkable&mdash;very!

     He 's dead,
     As I said,
     And the books of the sages have perished,
     But his wisdom is sacredly cherished.
     In "<i>Abracadabra</i>" it solemnly rings,
     Like an ancient bell that forever swings.
     Oh, I love to hear
     That word make clear
     Humanity's General Sense of Things.

     Jamrach Holobom.
</pre>
    <p>
      ABRIDGE, v. t. To shorten.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to
      abridge their king, a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires
      that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation."&mdash;Oliver
      Cromwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABRUPT, adj. Sudden, without ceremony, like the arrival of a cannonshot
      and the departure of the soldier whose interests are most affected by it.

      were "concatenated without abruption."

    <p>
      ABSCOND, v. i. To "move" in a mysterious way, commonly with the property

      hopelessly in the wrong; superseded in the consideration and affection of
      another.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     To men a man is but a mind. Who cares
     What face he carries or what form he wears?
     But woman's body is the woman. Oh,
     Stay thou, my sweetheart, and do never go.
     But heed the warning words the sage hath said:
     A woman absent is a woman dead.

    <p>
      ABSOLUTE, adj. Independent, irresponsible. An absolute monarchy is one in
      which the sovereign does as he pleases so long as he pleases the
      assassins. Not many absolute monarchies are left, most of them having been
      replaced by limited monarchies, where the sovereigns' power for evil (and
      for good) is greatly curtailed, and by republics, which are governed by
      chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABSTAINER, n. A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying
      himself a pleasure. A Total Abstainer is one who abstains from everything,
      but abstention, and especially from inactivity in the affairs of others.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Said a man to a crapulent youth: "I thought
     You a total abstainer, my son."
     "So I am, so I am," said the scapegrace caught&mdash;
     "But not, sir, a bigoted one."

     G. J.

      knowledge and complicity, as an attorney who defends a criminal, knowing
      him guilty. This view of the attorney's position in the matter has not

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One day a wag&mdash;what would the wretch be at?&mdash;
     Shifted a letter of the cipher RAT,
     And said it was a god's name! Straight arose
     Fantastic priests and postulants (with shows,
     And mysteries, and mummeries, and hymns,
     And disputations dire that lamed their limbs)
     To serve his temple and maintain the fires,
     Expound the law, manipulate the wires.

     Believe whate'er they cannot comprehend.
     And, inly edified to learn that two

      ASS, n. A public singer with a good voice but no ear. In Virginia City,
      Nevada, he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator, and
      everywhere the Donkey. The animal is widely and variously celebrated in
      the literature, art, and religion of every age and country; no other so
      engages and fires the human imagination as this noble vertebrate. Indeed,
      it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, <i>lib. II., De Clem</i>., and C.
      Stantatus, <i>De Temperamente</i>) if it is not a god; and as such we know
      it was worshipped by the Etruscans, and, if we may believe Macrobius, by
      the Capasians also. Of the only two animals admitted into the Mahometan
      Paradise along with the souls of men, the ass that carried Balaam is one,
      the dog of the Seven Sleepers the other. This is no small distinction.
      From what has been written about this beast might be compiled a library of
      great splendor and magnitude, rivaling that of the Shakspearean cult, and
      that which clusters about the Bible. It may be said, generally, that all
      literature is more or less Asinine.

      BAAL, n. A deity formerly much worshipped under various names. As Baal he
      was popular with the Phoenicians; as Belus or Bel he had the honor to be
      served by the priest Berosus, who wrote the famous account of the Deluge;
      as Babel he had a tower partly erected to his glory on the Plain of
      Shinar. From Babel comes our English word "babble." Under whatever name
      worshipped, Baal is the Sun-god. As Beelzebub he is the god of flies,
      which are begotten of the sun's rays on stagnant water. In Physicia Baal
      is still worshipped as Bolus, and as Belly he is adored and served with
      abundant sacrifice by the priests of Guttle and Swig.

      There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose

      gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved. Juno afterward restored the

      the archangel for bread.

      CABBAGE, n. A familiar kitchen-garden vegetable about as large and wise as
      a man's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabbage is so called from Cabagius, a prince who on ascending the
      throne issued a decree appointing a High Council of Empire, consisting of
      the members of his predecessor's Ministry and the cabbages in the royal
      garden. When any of His Majesty's measures of state policy miscarried
      conspicuously it was gravely announced that several members of the High
      Council had been beheaded, and his murmuring subjects were appeased.

      CACKLE, v. i. To celebrate the birth of an egg.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     They say that hens do cackle loudest when
     There's nothing vital in the egg they 've laid;
     And there are hens, professing to have made
     A study of mankind, who say that men
     Whose business is to drive the tongue or pen
     Make the most clamorous fanfaronade
     O'er their most worthless work, and I 'm afraid
     In this respect they 're really like the hen.

     Lo! the drum-major in his coat of gold,
     His blazing breeches and high-towering cap,

     Is that in battle he will never hurt you?

      CALAMITY, n. A more than commonly plain and unmistakable reminder that the

      CALLOUS, adj. Gifted with great fortitude to bear the evils afflicting
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Zeno was told that one of his enemies was no more he was observed to
      be deeply moved. "What!" said one of his disciples, "you weep at the death
      of an enemy?" "Ah, 't is true," replied the great Stoic; "but you should
      see me smile at the death of a friend."

    <p>
      CANNIBAL, n. A gastronome of the old school who preserves the simple
      tastes and adheres to the natural diet of the pre-pork period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practice of cannibalism was once universal, as the smallest knowledge
      of philology will serve to show. "Oblige us," says the erudite author of
      the <i>Delectatio Demonorum</i>, "by considering the derivation of the
      word 'sarcophagus,' and see if it be not suggestive of potted meats.
      Observe the significance of the phrase 'sweet sixteen.' What a world of
      meaning lurks in the expression 'she's as sweet as a peach,' and how
      suggestive of luncheon are the words 'tender youth!' A kiss is but a
      modified bite, and a fond mother, when she rapturously avers that her babe
      is 'almost good enough to eat,' merely shows that she is herself only a
      trifle too good to eat it."

      CAPITAL, n. The seat of misgovernment. That which provides the fire, the
      pot, the dinner, the table and the knife and fork for the anarchist. The
      part of the repast that himself supplies is the disgrace before meat. <i>Capital
      punishment</i>, a penalty regarding the justice and expediency of which
      many worthy persons&mdash;including all the assassins&mdash;entertain
      grave misgivings.
    </p>
    <p>
      CARMELITE, n. A mendicant friar of the order of Mt. Carmel.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     As Death was a-riding out one day,
     Across Mount Carmel he took his way,
     Where he met a mendicant monk,
     Some three or four quarters drunk,
     With a holy leer and a pious grin,
     Ragged and fat and as saucy as sin,
     Who held out his hands and cried:
     "Give, give in Charity's name, I pray.
     Give in the name of the Church. O give,
     Give that her holy sons may live!"
     And Death replied,
     Smiling long and wide:
     "I'll give, holy father, I'll give thee&mdash;
     a ride."

     With a rattle and bang
     Of his bones, he sprang
     From his famous Pale Horse, with his spear;
     By the neck and the foot
     Seized the fellow, and put
     Him astride with his face to the rear.

     The Monarch laughed loud with a sound that fell
     Like clods on the coffin's empty shell:
     "Ho, ho! A beggar on horseback, they say,
     Will ride to the devil!"&mdash;and thump
     Fell the flat of his dart on the rump
     Of the charger, which galloped away.

     Faster and faster and faster it flew,
     Till the rocks, and the flocks, and the trees that
     grew
     By the road, were dim, and blended, and blue
     To the wild, wide eyes
     Of the rider&mdash;in size
     Resembling a couple of blackberry pies.
     Death laughed again, as a tomb might laugh
     At a burial service spoiled,
     And the mourners' intentions foiled
     By the body erecting
     Its head and objecting
     To further proceedings in its behalf.

     Many a year and many a day
     Have passed since these events away.
     The monk has long been a dusty corse,
     And Death has never recovered his horse.

     For the friar got hold of its tail,
     And steered it within the pale
     Of the monastery gray,
     Where the beast was stabled and fed,
     With barley, and oil, and bread,
     Till fatter it grew than the fattest friar,
     And so in due course was appointed Prior.

      celebrated dictum, <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>&mdash; whereby he was pleased
      to suppose he demonstrated the reality of human existence. The dictum
      might be improved, however, thus: <i>Cogito cogito, ergo cogito sum</i>&mdash;"I

      CENTAUR, n. One of a race of persons who lived before the division of
      labor had been carried to such a pitch of differentiation, and who
      followed the primitive economic maxim, "Every man his own horse." The best
      of the lot was Chiron, who to the wisdom and virtues of the horse added
      the fleetness of man. The scripture story of the head of John the Baptist
      on a charger shows that pagan myths have somewhat sophisticated sacred
      history.

    <p>
      CERBERUS, n. The watch-dog of Hades, whose duty it was to guard the
      entrance&mdash;against whom or what does not clearly appear. Everybody,
      sooner or later, had to go there, and nobody wanted to carry off the
      entrance. Cerberus is known to have had three heads, and some of the poets
      have credited him with as many as a hundred. Professor Graybill, whose
      clerkly erudition and profound knowledge of Greek give his opinion great
      weight, has averaged all the estimates, and makes the number twenty-seven&mdash;a
      judgment that would be entirely conclusive if Professor Graybill had known
      (a) something about dogs, and (b) something about arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHILDHOOD, n. The period of human life intermediate between the idiocy of
      infancy and the folly of youth&mdash;two removes from the sin of manhood
      and three from the remorse of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      CHRISTIAN, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely
      inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor. One
      who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent
      with a life of sin.

     I dreamed I stood upon a hill, and, lo!
     The godly multitudes walked to and fro
     Beneath, in Sabbath garments fitly clad,
     With pious mien, appropriately sad,
     While all the church bells made a solemn din
     A fire-alarm to those who lived in sin.
     Then saw I gazing thoughtfully below,
     With tranquil face, upon that holy show
     A tall, spare figure in a robe of white,
     Whose eyes diffused a melancholy light.
     "God keep you, stranger," I exclaimed. "You are
     No doubt (your habit shows it) from afar;
     And yet I entertain the hope that you,
     Like these good people, are a Christian too."
     He raised his eyes and with a look so stern
     It made me with a thousand blushes burn
     Replied&mdash;his manner with disdain was spiced:

      CROSS, n. An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its

      worship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, to
      the rites of primitive peoples. We have today the White Cross as a symbol

      CUNNING, n. The faculty that distinguishes a weak animal or person from a
      strong one. It brings its possessor much mental satisfaction and great
      material adversity. An Italian proverb says: "The furrier gets the skins
      of more foxes than asses."

    <p>
      CUPID, n. The so-called god of love. This bastard creation of a barbarous
      fancy was no doubt inflicted upon mythology for the sins of its deities.
      Of all unbeautiful and inappropriate conceptions this is the most
      reasonless and offensive. The notion of symbolizing sexual love by a
      semisexless babe, and comparing the pains of passion to the wounds of an
      arrow &mdash;of introducing this pudgy homunculus into art grossly to
      materialize the subtle spirit and suggestion of the work&mdash;this is
      eminently worthy of the age that, giving it birth, laid it on the doorstep
      of posterity.

    <p>
      CURIOSITY, n. An objectionable quality of the female mind. The desire to
      know whether or not a woman is cursed with curiosity is one of the most
      active and insatiable passions of the masculine soul.

    <p>
      CURSE, v. t. Energetically to belabor with a verbal slap-stick. This is an
      operation which in literature, particularly in the drama, is commonly
      fatal to the victim. Nevertheless, the liability to a cursing is a risk
      that cuts but a small figure in fixing the rates of life insurance.

    <p>
      CYNIC, n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as
      they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a
      cynic's eyes to improve his vision.

      DAMN, int. A word formerly much used by the Paphlagonians, the meaning of
      which is lost. By the learned Dr. Dolabelly Gak it is believed to have
      been a term of satisfaction, implying the highest possible degree of
      mental tranquillity. Professor Groke, on the other hand, thinks it
      expressed an emotion of tumultuous delight, because it so frequently
      occurs in combination with the word <i>jod</i> or <i>god</i>, meaning
      "joy." It would be with great diffidence that I should advance an opinion
      conflicting with that of either of these formidable authorities.

    <p>
      DANCE, v. i. To leap about to the sound of tittering music, preferably
      with arms about your neighbor's wife or daughter. There are many kinds of
      dances, but all those requiring the participation of the two sexes have
      two characteristics in common: they are conspicuously innocent, and warmly

      DAWN, n. The time when men of reason go to bed. Certain old men prefer to
      rise at about that time, taking a cold bath and a long walk, with an empty
      stomach, and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to
      these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the
      truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but
      in spite of them. The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing
      is that it has killed all the others who have tried it.

      other sort. These two kinds of social activity overlap.

      war could have raised with ease. Homer never tires of sneering at the "men

      DULLARD, n. A member of the reigning dynasty in letters and life. The
      Dullards came in with Adam, and being both numerous and sturdy So have
      overrun the habitable world. The secret of their power is their
      insensibility to blows; tickle them with a bludgeon and they laugh with a
      platitude. The Dullards came originally from Boeotia, whence they were
      driven by stress of starvation, their dulness having blighted the crops.
      For some centuries they infested Philistia, and many of them are called
      Philistines to this day. In the turbulent times of the Crusades they
      withdrew thence and gradually overspread all Europe, occupying most of the
      high places in politics, art, literature, science, and theology. Since a
      detachment of Dullards came over with the Pilgrims in the <i>Mayflower</i>
      and made a favorable report of the country, their increase by birth,
      immigration, and conversion has been rapid and steady. According to the
      most trustworthy statistics the number of adult Dullards in the United
      States is but little short of thirty millions, including the
      statisticians. The intellectual centre of the race is somewhere about

      EDITOR, n. A person who combines the judicial functions of Minos,
      Rhadamanthus and Æacus, but is placable with an obolus; a severely
      virtuous censor, but so charitable withal that he tolerates the virtues of
      others and the vices of himself; who flings about him the splintering
      lightning and sturdy thunders of admonition till he resembles a bunch of
      firecrackers petulantly uttering its mind at the tail of a dog; then
      straightway murmurs a mild, melodious lay, soft as the cooing of a donkey
      intoning its prayer to the evening star. Master of mysteries and lord of
      law, high-pinnacled upon the throne of thought, his face suffused with the
      dim Splendors of the Transfiguration, his legs intertwisted and his tongue
      a-cheek, the editor spills his will along the paper and cuts it off in
      lengths to suit. And at intervals from behind the veil of the temple is
      heard the voice of the foreman demanding three inches of wit and six lines
      of religious meditation, or bidding him turn off the wisdom and whack up
      some pathos.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     O, the Lord of Law on the Throne of Thought,

     And his power is fiddle-dee-dee.

      EFFECT, n. The second of two phenomena which always occur together in the
      same order. The first, called a Cause, is said to generate the other&mdash;

     Megaceph, chosen to serve the State

      ELECTRICITY, n. The power that causes all natural phenomena not known to
      be caused by something else. It is the same thing as lightning, and its
      famous attempt to strike Dr. Franklin is one of the most picturesque
      incidents in that great and good man's career. The memory of Dr. Franklin
      is justly held in great reverence, particularly in France, where a waxen

      account of his life and services to science:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Franqulin, inventor of electricity. This illustrious savant,
      after having made several voyages around the world, died on the Sandwich
      Islands and was devoured by savages, of whom not a single fragment was
      ever recovered."

      Electricity seems destined to play a most important part in the arts and
      industries. The question of its economical application to some purposes is
      still unsettled, but experiment has already proved that it will propel a
      street car better than a gas jet and give more light than a horse.

      ELEGY, n. A composition in verse, in which, without employing any of the
      methods of humor, the writer aims to produce in the reader's mind the

      like this:

      EMBALM, v. t. To cheat vegetation by locking up the gases upon which it
      feeds. By embalming their dead and thereby deranging the natural balance
      between animal and vegetable life, the Egyptians made their once fertile
      and populous country barren and incapable of supporting more than a meagre
      crew. The modern metallic burial casket is a step in the same direction,
      and many a dead man who ought now to be ornamenting his neighbor's lawn as
      a tree, or enriching his table as a bunch of radishes, is doomed to a long
      inutility. We shall get him after awhile if we are spared, but in the

    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash; Pfeiffer &amp; Co., Boston, 1803:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunarian: Then when your Congress has passed a law it goes directly to
      the Supreme Court in order that it may at once be known whether it is
      constitutional.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrestrian: O no; it does not require the approval of the Supreme Court
      until having perhaps been enforced for many years somebody objects to its
      operation against himself&mdash;I mean his client. The President, if he
      approves it, begins to execute it at once.

      policemen also have to approve the local ordinances that they enforce?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrestrian: Not yet&mdash;at least not in their capacity of constables.
      Generally speaking though, all laws require the approval of those whom
      they are intended to restrain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunarian: Ah, I see. The death warrant is not valid until signed by the
      murderer.

      "Terrestrian: My friend, you put it too strongly; we are not so
      consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunarian: But this system of maintaining an expensive judicial machinery
      to pass upon the validity of laws only after they have long been executed,
      and then only when brought before the court by some private person&mdash;does
      it not cause great confusion?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrestrian: It does.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lunarian: Why then should not your laws, previously to being executed, be
      validated, not by the signature of your President, but by that of the
      Chief Justice of the Supreme Court?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrestrian: There is no precedent for any such course.

      An English sea-captain being asked if he had read "The Exile of Erin,"

      FAIRY, n. A creature, variously fashioned and endowed, that formerly
      inhabited the meadows and forests. It was nocturnal in its habits, and
      somewhat addicted to dancing and theft of children. The fairies are now
      believed by naturalists to be extinct, though a clergyman of the Church of
      England saw three near Colchester as lately as 1855, while passing through
      a park after dining with the lord of the manor. The sight greatly
      staggered him, and he was so affected that his account of it was
      incoherent. In the year 1807 a troop of fairies visited a wood near Aix
      and carried off the daughter of a peasant, who had been seen to enter it
      with a bundle of clothing. The son of a wealthy <i>bourgeois</i>
      disappeared about the same time, but afterward returned. He had seen the
      abduction and been in pursuit of the fairies. Justinian Gaux, a writer of
      the fourteenth century, avers that so great is the fairies' power of
      transformation that he saw one change itself into two opposing armies and
      fight a battle with great slaughter, and that the next day, after it had
      resumed its original shape and gone away, there were seven hundred bodies
      of the slain which the villagers had to bury. He does not say if any of
      the wounded recovered. In the time of Henry III, of England, a law was
      made which prescribed the death penalty for "Kyllynge, wowndynge, or
      mamynge" a fairy, and it was universally respected.

      FEAST, n. A festival. A religious celebration signalized by gluttony and
      drunkenness, frequently in honor of some holy person distinguished for
      abstemiousness. In the Roman Catholic Church feasts are "movable" and
      "immovable," but the celebrants are uniformly immovable until they are
      full. In their earliest development these entertainments took the form of
      feasts for the dead; such were held by the Greeks, under the name of <i>Nemeseia</i>,
      by the Aztecs and Peruvians, as in modern times they are popular with the
      Chinese; though it is believed that the ancient dead, like the modern,
      were light eaters. Feasts <i>on</i> the dead are celebrated with great <i>éclat</i>
      in Fiji. Among the many feasts of the Romans was the <i>Novemdiale</i>,
      which was held, according to Livy, whenever stones fell from heaven. Of
      all the feast days of the various Christian churches none has any sanction
      in the gospel. Men make gods of their bellies, and then these gods ordain

      FLY-SPECK, The prototype of punctuation. It is observed by Garvinus that
      the systems of punctuation in use by the various literary nations depended
      originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting
      the several countries. These creatures, which have always been
      distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors,
      liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth
      under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of
      the work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of,
      the writer's powers. The "old masters" of literature&mdash;that is to say,
      the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics
      in the same language&mdash;never punctuated at all, but worked right along
      free-handed, without that abruption of' the thought which comes from the
      use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage
      in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that
      the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of
      development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these
      primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator
      with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by
      the writers' ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly&mdash;<i>Musca
      maledicta</i>. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose either
      of making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as
      divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever
      marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable
      enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers
      contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious
      advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as
      the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival
      and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of
      punctuation, which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important
      services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a
      page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molassess in
      a sunny room and observe "how the wit brightens and the style refines" in
      accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.

      FROG, n. An amphibious reptile with edible kickers. When young, this
      creature is called a Mary wog or Thaddeuspole, and as such maintains a
      tail, subsequently eschewed. The first mention of frogs in profane
      literature is in Homer's narrative of the war between them and the mice.
      Skeptical persons have doubted Homer's authorship of the work, but the
      learned, ingenious, and industrious Dr. Schliemann has set the question
      forever at rest by uncovering the bones of the slain frogs. One of the
      forms of moral suasion by which Pharaoh was lobbied in favor of the
      Israelites was a plague of frogs, but Pharaoh, who liked them <i>fricasêe</i>,
      remarked, with truly oriental stoicism, that he could stand it as long as
      the frogs and the Jews could; so the programme was changed. The frog is a
      diligent songster, having a good voice but no ear. The libretto of his
      favorite opera, as written by Aristophanes, is brief, simple, and
      effective&mdash;"brekekex-koâx"; the music is apparently by that eminent

      baptism; but observing one day the horrible torment of a tramp who had
      incautiously pulled a fried babe from the waste-dump and devoured it, it
      occurred to the great divine to rob death of its terrors by introducing
      the frying-pan into every household in Geneva. Thence it spread to all
      corners of the world, and has been of invaluable assistance in the
      propagation of his sombre faith. The following lines (said to be from the
      pen of His Grace Bishop Potter) seem to imply that the usefulness of this
      utensil is not limited to this world; but as the consequences of its
      employment in this life reach over into the life to come, so also itself
      may be found on the other side, rewarding its devotees:

      GARGOYLE, n. A rain-spout projecting from the eaves of mediæval buildings,
      commonly fashioned into a grotesque caricature of some personal enemy of
      the architect or owner of the building. This was especially the case in
      churches and ecclesiastical structures generally, in which the gargoyles
      presented a perfect rogues' gallery of local heretics and
      controversialists. Sometimes when a new dean and chapter were installed
      the old gargoyles were removed and others substituted having a closer

      Accounting for the uncommon behavior of ghosts, Heine mentions somebody's
      ingenious theory to the effect that they are as much afraid of us as we of
      them. Not quite, if I may judge from such tables of comparative speed as I
      am able to compile from memories of my own experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one insuperable obstacle to a belief in ghosts. A ghost never
      comes naked: he appears either in a winding-sheet or "in his habit as he
      lived." To believe in him, then, is to believe that not only have the dead
      the power to make themselves visible after there is nothing left of them,
      but that the same extraordinary gift inheres in textile fabrics. Supposing
      the products of the loom to have this ability, what object would they have
      in exercising it? And why does not the apparition of a suit of clothes
      sometimes walk abroad without a ghost in it? These be riddles of
      significance. They reach away down and get a convulsive grasp on the very
      tap-root of this flourishing faith.

    <p>
      GHOUL, n. A demon addicted to the reprehensible habit of devouring the
      dead. The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of
      controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of
      comforting beliefs than give it anything good in their place, but nobody
      now seriously denies it. In 1640 Father Seechi saw one in a cemetery near
      Florence and frightened it away with the sign of the cross. He describes
      it as gifted with several heads and an uncommon allowance of limbs, and he
      saw it in more than one place at a time. The good man was coming away from
      dinner at the time and explains that if he had not been "heavy with
      eating" he would have seized the demon at all hazards. Atholston relates
      that a ghoul was caught by some sturdy peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury
      and ducked in a horsepond. (He appears to think that so distinguished a
      criminal should have been ducked in a tank of rose-water.) The water
      turned at once to blood "and so contynues unto ys daye." The pond has
      since been bled with a ditch. As late as the beginning of the last century
      a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of the cathedral at Amiens and the whole
      population surrounded the place. Twenty armed men with a priest at their
      head, bearing a crucifix, entered and captured the ghoul, which, thinking
      to escape by the stratagem, had transformed itself to the semblance of a
      well-known citizen, but was nevertheless hanged, drawn and quartered in
      the midst of hideous popular orgies. The citizen whose shape the demon had
      assumed was so affected by the sinister occurrence that he never again
      showed himself in Amiens and his fate remains a mystery.

      GNOME, n. In North-European mythology, a dwarfish imp inhabiting the
      interior parts of the earth and having special custody of mineral
      treasures. Bjorsen, who died in 1765, says gnomes were common enough in
      the southern parts of Sweden in his boyhood, and he frequently saw them
      scampering on the hills in the evening twilight. Ludwig Binkerhoof saw
      three as recently as 1792, in the Black Forest, and Sneddeker avers that
      in 1803 they drove a party of miners out of a Silesian mine. Basing our
      computations upon data supplied by these statements, we find that the
      gnomes probably became extinct about 1640.

      GUILLOTINE, n. A machine which makes a Frenchman shrug his shoulders with
      good reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his great work on <i>Divergent Lines of Racial Evolution</i>, the
      learned and ingenious Professor Brayfugle argues from the prevalence of
      this gesture&mdash;the shrug&mdash;among Frenchmen, that they are
      descended from turtles, and it is simply a survival of the habit of
      retracting the head inside the shell. It is with reluctance that I differ
      with so eminent an authority, but in my judgment (as more elaborately set
      forth and enforced in my work entitled <i>Hereditary Emotions</i> &mdash;
      lib. II, c. XI) the shrug is a poor foundation upon which to build so
      important a theory, for previously to the Revolution the gesture was
      unknown. I have not a doubt that it is directly referable to the terror
      inspired by the guillotine during the period of that instrument's awful
      activity.

    <p>
      GUNPOWDER, n. An agency employed by civilized nations for the settlement
      of disputes which might become troublesome if left unadjusted. By most
      writers the invention of gunpowder is ascribed to the Chinese, but not
      upon very convincing evidence. Milton says it was invented by the devil to
      kill angels with, and this opinion seems to derive some support from the
      scarcity of angels. Moreover, it has the hearty concurrence of the Hon.
      James Wilson, Secretary of Agriculture. Secretary Wilson became interested
      in gunpowder through an event that occurred on the Government experimental
      farm in the District of Columbia. One day, some years ago, some rogue,
      imperfectly reverent of his profound attainments and personal character,
      presented him with a sack of gunpowder, representing it as the seed of the
      <i>Flashawful flabbergastor</i>, a Patagonian cereal of great commercial
      value, admirably adapted to this climate. The good Secretary was
      instructed to spill it along in a furrow and afterward inhume it with
      soil. This he at once proceeded to do, and had made a continuous line of
      it all the way across a ten-acre field, when he was made to look backward
      by a shout from the generous donor, who at once dropped a lighted match
      into the furrow at the starting-point. Contact with the earth had somewhat
      dampened the powder, but the startled functionary saw himself pursued by a
      tall moving pillar of fire and smoke in fierce evolution. He stood for a
      moment paralyzed and speechless, then he recollected an engagement, and,
      dropping all, absented himself thence with such surprising celerity that
      to the eyes of spectators along the route selected he appeared like a
      long, dim streak of farmer prolonging itself with inconceivable rapidity
      through seven villages, and audibly refusing to be comforted. "Great
      Scott! what is that?" cried a surveyor's chainman, shading his eyes and
      gazing at the fading line of agriculturist which bisected his visible
      horizon. "That," said the surveyor, carelessly, glancing at the phenomenon
      and again centring his attention upon his instrument, "is the Meridian of
      Washington."

      Among the ancients the idea of Hades was not synonymous with our Hell,
      many of the most respectable men of antiquity residing there in a very
      comfortable kind of way. Indeed, the Elysian Fields themselves were a part
      of Hades, though they have since been removed to Paris. When the Jacobean
      version of the New Testament was in process of evolution the pious and
      learned men engaged in the work insisted by a majority vote on translating
      the Greek word "Hades" as "Hell"; but a conscientious minority member
      secretly possessed himself of the record and struck out the objectionable
      word wherever he could find it. At the next meeting, the Bishop of
      Winchester, looking over the work, suddenly sprang to his feet and said
      with considerable excitement: "Gentlemen, somebody has been razing 'Hell'
      here!" Years afterwards the good prelate's death was made sweet by the

      lumination or nimbus&mdash;hag being the popular name of that peculiar
      electrical light sometimes observed in the hair. At one time hag was not a

      HALF, n. One of two equal parts into which a thing may be divided, or

      among the theologists and philosophers as to whether Omniscience could
      part an object into three halves; and the pious Father Aldrovinus publicly
      prayed in the cathedral at Rouen that God would demonstrate the
      affirmative of the proposition in some signal and unmistakable way, and
      particularly (if it should please Him) upon the body of that hardy

      HALO, n. Properly, a luminous ring encircling an astronomical body, but
      not infrequently confounded with "aureola," or "nimbus," a somewhat
      similar phenomenon worn as a head-dress by divinities and saints. The halo
      is a purely optical illusion, produced by moisture in the air, in the
      manner of a rainbow; but the aureola is conferred as a sign of superior
      sanctity, in the same way as a bishop's mitre, or the Pope's tiara. In the
      painting of the Nativity, by Szedgkin, a pious artist of Pesth, not only
      do the Virgin and the Child wear the nimbus, but an ass nibbling hay from
      the sacred manger is similarly decorated and, to his lasting honor be it

      knew nothing of it and intrusted its duties to the sleeve. Shakespeare's
      introducing it into the play of "Othello" is an anachronism: Desdamona

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In ancient times there lived a king
     Whose tax-collectors could not wring
     From all his subjects gold enough
     To make the royal way less rough.
     For pleasure's highway, like the dames
     Whose premises adjoin it, claims
     Perpetual repairing. So
     The tax-collectors in a row
     Appeared before the throne to pray
     Their master to devise some way
     To swell the revenue. "So great,"
     Said they, "are the demands of state
     A tithe of all that we collect
     Will scarcely meet them. Pray reflect:
     How, if one-tenth we must resign,
     Can we exist on t'other nine?"
     The monarch asked them in reply:
     "Has it occurred to you to try
     The advantage of economy?"
     "It has," the spokesman said: "we sold
     All of our gay garrotes of gold;
     With plated-ware we now compress
     The necks of those whom we assess.
     Plain iron forceps we employ
     To mitigate the miser's joy
     Who hoards, with greed that never tires,
     That which your Majesty requires."
     Deep lines of thought were seen to plow
     Their way across the royal brow.
     "Your state is desperate, no question;
     Pray favor me with a suggestion."
     "O King of Men," the spokesman said,
     "If you 'll impose upon each head
     A tax, the augmented revenue
     We 'll cheerfully divide with you."
     As flashes of the sun illume
     The parted storm-cloud's sullen gloom,
     The king smiled grimly. "I decree
     That it be so&mdash;and, not to be
     In generosity outdone,
     Declare you, each and every one,
     Exempted from the operation
     Of this new law of capitation.
     But lest the people censure me
     Because they 're bound and you are free,
     'T were well some clever scheme were laid
     By you this poll-tax to evade.
     I 'll leave you now while you confer
     With my most trusted minister."
     The monarch from the throne-room walked
     And straightway in among them stalked
     A silent man, with brow concealed,
     Bare-armed&mdash;his gleaming axe revealed!

      HEART, n. An automatic, muscular blood-pump. Figuratively, this useful
      organ is said to be the seat of emotions and sentiments&mdash;a very
      pretty fancy which, however, is nothing but a survival of a once universal
      belief. It is now known that the sentiments and emotions reside in the
      stomach, being evolved from food by chemical action of the gastric fluid.
      The exact process by which a beefsteak becomes a feeling&mdash;tender or
      not, according to the age of the animal from which it was cut; the
      successive stages of elaboration through which a caviare sandwich is
      transmuted to a quaint fancy and reappears as a pungent epigram; the
      marvellous functional methods of converting a hard-boiled egg into
      religious contrition, or a cream-puff into a sigh of sensibility&mdash;these
      things have been patiently ascertained by M. Pasteur, and by him expounded
      with convincing lucidity. (See, also, my monograph on "The Essential
      Identity of the Spiritual Affections and Certain Intestinal Gases Freed in
      Digestion"&mdash;4to, 687 pp.) In a scientific work entitled, I believe,
      <i>Delectatio Demonorum</i> (John Camden Hotten, London, 1873) this view
      of the sentiments receives a striking illustration and support in the
      author's account of an experiment made with a view to testing it. The
      stomach of a man who had died of a surfeit of turkey on Thanksgiving Day
      was removed and kept tightly closed until it was greatly distended with
      the gases produced by digestion. The compression on the neck of it being
      then relaxed, the words, "Praise God from whom all blessings flow!" were
      heard with distinct articulation, as the swollen organ collapsed. It is
      nonsense to ignore, belittle, pervert or deny the significance of a fact
      like that. For further light upon this subject, consult Professor Dam's
      famous treatise on "Love as a product of Alimentary Maceration."

      HIBERNATE, v. To pass the winter season in domestic seclusion. There have
      been many singular popular notions about the hibernation of various
      animals. Many believe that the bear hibernates during the whole winter and
      subsists by mechanically sucking its paws. It is admitted that it comes
      out of its retirement in the spring so lean that it has to try twice
      before it can cast a shadow. Three or four centuries ago, in England, no
      fact was better attested than that swallows passed the winter months in
      the mud at the bottoms of the brooks, clinging together in globular
      masses. They have apparently been compelled to give up the custom on
      account of the foulness of the brooks. Sotus Escobius discovered in
      Central Asia a whole nation of people who hibernated. By some
      investigators, the fasting of Lent is supposed to have been originally a
      modified form of hibernation, to which the Church gave a religious
      significance; but this view is strenuously opposed by that eminent
      authority, Bishop Kip, who does not wish any honors denied to the memory
      of the Founder of his family.

      HOG, n. A bird remarkable for the catholicity of its appetite and serving

      in favor as an article of diet, but is respected for the delicacy of its
      habits, the beauty of its plumage, and the melody of its voice. It is
      chiefly as a songster that the fowl is esteemed; a cage of him in full
      chorus has been known to draw tears from two persons at once. The

      IMPALE, v. t. In popular usage to pierce with any weapon which remains
      fixed in the wound. This, however, is inaccurate; to impale is, properly,
      to put to death by thrusting an upright sharp stake into the body, the
      victim being left in a sitting position. This was a common mode of
      punishment among many of the nations of antiquity, and is still in high
      favor in China and other parts of Asia. Down to the beginning of the
      Fifteenth Century it was widely employed in churching heretics and
      schismatics. Wolecraft calls it the "stoole of repentynge," and among the
      common people it was jocularly known as "riding the one legged horse."
      Ludwig Salzmann informs us that in Thibet impalement is considered the
      most appropriate punishment for crimes against religion; and although in
      China it is sometimes awarded to secular offences, it is most frequently
      adjudged in cases of sacrilege. To the person in actual experience of
      impalement it must be a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil
      or religious dissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts; but
      doubtless he would feel a certain satisfaction if able to contemplate
      himself in the character of a weather-cock on the spire of the True
      Church.

      INADMISSIBLE, adj. Not competent to be considered. Said of certain kinds
      of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with,
      and which judges, therefore, rule out, even of proceedings before
      themselves alone. Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person
      quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet the
      most momentous actions, military, political, commercial, and of every
      other kind, are daily undertaken on hearsay evidence. There is no religion
      in the world that has any other basis than hearsay evidence. Revelation is
      hearsay evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the
      testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and
      who are not known to have been sworn in any sense. Under the rules of
      evidence as they now exist in this country, no single assertion in the
      Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law. It
      cannot be proved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought, that there
      was such a person as Julius Cæsar, such an empire as Assyria. But as
      records of courts of justice are admissible, it can easily be proved that
      powerful and malevolent magicians once existed and were a scourge to
      mankind. The evidence (including confession) upon which certain women were
      convicted of witchcraft and executed was without a flaw; it is still
      absolutely unimpeachable. The judges' decisions based on it were sound in
      logic and in law. Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly
      proved than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many
      suffered death. If there are no witches, human testimony and human reason
      are alike destitute of value.

      INAUSPICIOUSLY, adv. In an unpromising manner, the auspices being
      unfavorable. Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any
      important action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs, or state
      prophets, some hint of its probable outcome; and one of their favorite and
      most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the flight of
      birds&mdash;&mdash;the omens thence derived being called <i>auspices</i>.
      Newspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided that
      the word&mdash;always in the plural&mdash;shall mean "patronage" or
      "management"; as, "The festivities were under the auspices of the Ancient
      and Honorable Order of Body-Snatchers"; or, "The hilarities were
      auspicated by the Knights of Hunger."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A Roman slave appeared one day
     Before the Augur. "Tell me, pray,
     If&mdash;" here the Augur, smiling, made
     A checking gesture and displayed
     His open palm, which plainly itched,
     For visibly its surface twitched.
     An <i>obolus</i> (the Latin nickel)
     Successfully allayed the tickle,
     And then the slave proceeded: "Please
     Inform me whether Fate decrees
     Success or failure in what I
     To-night (if it be dark) shall try.
     Its nature? Never mind&mdash;I think
     'T is writ on this"&mdash;and with a wink
     Which darkened half the earth, he drew
     Another <i>obolus</i> to view,
     Its brazen face attentive scanned,
     Then slipped it in the good man's hand,
     Who with great gravity said: "Wait
     While I retire to question Fate."
     That holy person then withdrew
     His sacred clay and passing through
     The temple's rearward gate, cried "Shoo!"
     Waving his robe of office. Straight
     Each sacred peacock and its mate
     (Maintained for Juno's favor) fled
     With clamor from the trees overhead,
     Where they were perching for the night.
     The temple's roof received their flight,
     For thither they would always go
     When danger threatened them below.
     Back to the slave the Augur went:
     "My son, forecasting the event
     By flight of birds, I must confess
     The auspices deny success."
     That slave retired, a sadder man,
     Abandoning his secret plan&mdash;
     Which was (as well the crafty seer
     Had from the first divined) to clear
     The wall and fraudulently seize
     On Juno's poultry in the trees.

      INCOME, n. The natural and rational gauge and measure of respectability,
      the commonly accepted standards being artificial, arbitrary, and
      fallacious; for, as "Sir Sycophas Aureolater" in the play has justly
      remarked, "the true use and function of property (in whatsoever it
      consisteth&mdash;coins, or land, or houses, or merchant-stuff, or anything
      which may be named as holden of right to one's own subservience) as also
      of honors, titles, preferments, and place, and all favor and acquaintance
      of persons of quality or ableness, are but to get money. Hence it
      followeth that all things are truly to be rated as of worth in measure of
      their serviceableness to that end; and their possessors should take rank
      in agreement thereto, neither the lord of an unproducing manor, howsoever
      broad and ancient, nor he who bears an unremunerate dignity, nor yet the
      pauper favorite of a king, being esteemed of level excellency with him
      whose riches are of daily accretion; and hardly should they whose wealth
      is barren claim and rightly take more honor than the poor and unworthy."

      INCOMPATIBILITY, n. In matrimony a similarity of tastes, particularly the
      taste for domination. Incompatibility may, however, consist of a meekeyed
      matron living just around the corner. It has even been known to wear a
      moustache.

    <p>
      INCOMPOSSIBLE, adj. Unable to exist if something else exists. Two things
      are incompossible when the world of being has scope enough for one of
      them, but not enough for both&mdash; as the poet Gilder and God's mercy
      to man. Incompossibility, it will be seen, is only incompatibility let
      loose. Instead of such low language as "Go heel yourself&mdash;I mean to
      kill you on sight," the words, "Sir, we are incompossible," would convey
      an equally significant intimation, and in stately courtesy are altogether
      superior.

    <p>
      INCUBUS, n. One of a race of highly improper demons who, though probably

      complete account of <i>incubi and suecubi, including incuba and succuba</i>,
      see the <i>Liber Demonorum</i> of Protassus (Paris, 1328), which contains
      much curious information that would be out of place in a dictionary
      intended as a text-book for the public schools. Victor Hugo relates that
      in the Channel Islands Satan himself&mdash;tempted more than elsewhere by
      the beauty of the women, doubtless&mdash;sometimes plays at <i>incubus</i>,
      greatly to the inconvenience and alarm of the good dames who wish to be
      loyal to their marriage vows, generally speaking. A certain lady applied
      to the parish priest to learn how they might, in the dark, distinguish the
      hardy intruder from their husbands. The holy man said they must feel his
      brow for horns; but Hugo is ungallant enough to hint a doubt of the
      efficacy of the test.

      that he who from indecision standeth still hath not so many chances of

      INFERÏÆ, [Latin.] n. Among the Greeks and Romans, sacrifices for
      propitiation of the <i>Dii Manes</i>, or souls of dead heroes; for the
      pious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual
      needs, and had to have a number of makeshift deities, or, as a sailor
      might say, jury-gods, which they made out of the most unpromising
      materials. It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of Agamemnon
      that Laiaides, a priest of Aulis, was favored with an audience of that
      illustrious warrior's shade, who prophetically recounted to him the birth
      of Christ and the triumph of Christianity, giving him also a rapid but
      tolerably complete review of events down to the reign of Saint Louis. The
      narrative ended abruptly at that point owing to the inconsiderate crowing
      of a cock, which compelled the ghosted King of Men to scamper back to
      Hades. There is a fine mediæval flavor to this story, and as it has not
      been traced back further than Père Brateille, a pious but obscure writer
      at the court of Saint Louis, we shall probably not err on the side of
      presumption in considering it apocryphal, though Monsignor Capels judgment
      of the matter might be different; and to that I bow-wow.

      organ known as the spleen is nothing less than our immortal part. To the
      contrary, Professor Garrett P. Serviss holds that man's soul is that
      prolongation of his spinal marrow which forms the pith of his no tail; and
      for demonstration of his faith points confidently to the fact that tailed

      INSURANCE, n. An ingenious modern game of chance in which the player is

      Insurance Agent: My dear sir, that is a fine house&mdash;pray let me
      insure it.
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: With pleasure. Please make the annual premium so low that by
      the time when, according to the tables of your actuary, it will probably
      be destroyed by fire I will have paid you considerably less than the face
      of the policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Agent: O dear, no&mdash;we could not afford to do that. We must
      fix the premium so that you will have paid more.
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: How, then, can I afford that?
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Agent: Why, your house may burn down at any time. There was
      Smith's house, for example, which&mdash; House Owner: Spare me&mdash;there

    <p>

      the supposition that something will occur previously to the time set by
      yourself for its occurrence. In other words, you expect me to bet that my
      house will not last so long as it will probably last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Agent: But if your house burns without insurance it will be a
      total loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: Beg your pardon&mdash; by your own actuary's tables I
      shall probably have saved, when it burns, all the premiums I would
      otherwise have paid to you&mdash;amounting to more than the face of the
      policy they would have bought. But suppose it to burn before the time upon
      which your figures are based. If I could afford that, how could you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Agent: Oh, we would make ourselves even from our luckier
      ventures with other clients. Virtually, they pay your loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: And virtually, then, don't I help to pay their losses? Are
      not their houses as likely as mine to burn before they have paid you as
      much as you must pay them? The case stands this way: You expect to take
      more money from your clients than you pay to them, do you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Agent: Certainly; if we did not&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: I would not trust you with my money unless you did reference
      to the whole body of your clients, that they lose money on you it is <i>probable</i>,
      with reference to any one of them, that <i>he</i> will. It is these
      individual probabilities that make the aggregate certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurance Agent: I will not deny it&mdash;but look at the figures in this
      pamph&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: Heaven forbid! Insurance Agent: You spoke of saving the
      premiums which you would otherwise pay to me. Will you not be more likely
      to squander them? We offer you an incentive to thrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      House Owner: The willingness of A to take care of B's money is not
      peculiar to insurance, but as a charitable institution you command esteem.

      introduction attains in this country its most malevolent development,
      being, indeed, closely related to our political system. Every American
      being the equal of every other American, it follows that everybody has the
      right to know everybody else, which implies the right to introduce without
      request or permission. The Declaration of Independence should have read
      thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created nice
      and equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
      rights; that among these are life, and the right to make that of another
      miserable by thrusting upon him an incalculable quantity of acquaintances;
      liberty, particularly the liberty to introduce persons to one another

      J
    </h2>
    <p>
      J is a consonant in English, but some nations use it as a vowel&mdash;than
      which nothing could be more absurd. Its original form, which has been but
      slightly modified, was that of the tail of a subdued dog, and it was not a
      letter but a character, standing for the Latin verb <i>jacere</i>, "to
      throw," because when a stone is thrown at a dog the dog's tail assumes
      that shape. This is the origin of the letter, as expounded by the learned
      and renowned Dr. Jocolpus Burner, of the University of Belgrade, who
      established his conclusions on the subject in a work of three quarto
      volumes and committed suicide on being reminded that the j in the Roman
      alphabet had originally no curl.

      JESTER, n. An officer formerly attached to a king's household, whose
      business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and utterances,
      the absurdity being attested by his motley costume. The king himself being
      attired with dignity, it took the world some centuries to discover that
      his own conduct and decrees were sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement
      not only of his court but of all mankind. The jester was commonly called a
      fool, but the poets and romancers have ever delighted to represent him as
      a singularly wise and witty person. In the circus clown of to-day the
      melancholy ghost of the court fool effects the dejection of humbler
      audiences with the same jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble
      hall, panged the patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal
      tears.

     My sins are more than scarlet:
     I love my fool&mdash;blaspheming clown,
     And common, base-born varlet."

     "Daughter," the mimic priest replied,
     "That sin, indeed, is awful:
     The church's pardon is denied
     To love that is unlawful.

     "But since thy stubborn heart will be
     For him forever pleading,
     Thou 'dst better make him, by decree,
     A man of birth and breeding."

     She made the fool a duke, in hope

     Who damned her from the altar!

    <h2>
      K
    </h2>
    <p>
      K is a consonant that we get from the Greeks, but it can be traced away
      back beyond them to the Cerathians, a small commercial nation inhabiting
      the peninsula of Smero. In their tongue it was called Klatch, which means
      "destroyed." The form of the letter was originally precisely that of our
      H, but the erudite and ingenious Dr. Snedeker explains that it was altered
      to its present shape to commemorate the destruction of the great temple of
      Jarute by an earthquake, <i>circa</i> 730 b. c. This building was famous
      for the two lofty columns of its portico, one of which was broken in half
      by the catastrophe, the other remaining intact. As the earlier form of the
      letter is supposed to have been suggested by these pillars, so, it is
      thought by the great antiquary, its later was adopted as a simple and
      natural&mdash;not to say touching&mdash;means of keeping the calamity ever
      in the national memory. It is not known if the name of the letter was
      altered as an additional mnemonic, or if the name was always <i>Klatch</i>
      and the destruction one of nature's puns. As each theory seems probable
      enough, I see no objection to believing both&mdash; and Dr. Snedeker
      arrayed himself on that side of the question.

      KING'S EVIL, n. A malady that was formerly cured by the touch of the

      pious Edward" of England used to lay his royal hand upon his ailing
      subjects and make them whole&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "a crowd of wretched souls

      as the "Doctor" in <i>Macbeth</i> hath it. This useful property of the

      But the gift somewhere dropped out of the line of succession: the later
      sovereigns of England have not been tactual healers, and the disease once
      honored with the name "king's evil" now bears the humbler one of
      "scrofula," from <i>scrofa</i>, a sow. The date and author of the

      LAND, n. A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory

      foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the
      superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have
      the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the
      right exclusively to occupy, and in fact laws of trespass are enacted
      wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area
      of <i>terra firma</i> is owned by A, B, and C, there will be no place for
      D, E, F, and G to be born on, or, being born as trespassers, to exist on.

      Whether laughter could be imparted to animals by inoculation from the
      human patient is a question that has not been answered by experimentation.
      Dr. Weir Mitchell holds that the infectious character of laughter is due
      to instantaneous fermentation of <i>sputa</i> diffused in a spray. From

      duties of the modern lawyer is defense of eminent rogues by vituperation
      of "anonymous scribblers" of the press&mdash;an employment which drew from
      that "scurril jester," Editor Fum, of "The Daily Livercomplaint," the
      hortatory words here following:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Take notice, lawyers all. For many a year
     Your cheerful tribe (I mean to stint your cheer)
     When hired to cheat the gallows of its prey
     Or turn the law-dogs' noses all astray
     From a thief's track, and take of what he stole
     The lion's share&mdash;that is to say, the whole&mdash;
     Have deemed it right his grievance to redress
     With fine philippics on the brutal press
     That persecutes a blameless soul&mdash;alas,
     How angels suffer from the felon class!
     Now mark ye, lawless lawyers, if ye still
     Shall think it well to serve a client ill,
     Accept his money on the false pretense
     That slander of accusers is defense,
     Deal out damnation to sustain his hope
     And handle without gloves all things but soap,
     I 'm for retaliation. Hear me swear,
     With head uncovered and with hand in air,
     By that sole deity whom lawyers hold
     In pious reverence, Almighty Gold
     (Whose name, with deep hypocrisy, they spell,
     Pronounce and take in vain without the l)
     My scourging weapon shall remain unstirred,
     Gracing the pinion of its parent bird.
     I 'll let you struggle for the blackguard's wreath
     And tear your tongues to rags upon your teeth!

    <p>
      LAZINESS, n. Unwarranted repose of manner in a person of low degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEAD, n. A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to light
      lovers&mdash;particularly to those who love not wisely but other men's
      wives. Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an argument of
      such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong way. An
      interesting fact in the chemistry of international controversy is that at
      the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is precipitated in great
      quantities.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Hail, holy Lead!&mdash;of human feuds the great
     And universal arbiter; endowed
     With penetration to pierce any cloud
     Fogging the field of controversial hate,
     And with a swift, inevitable, straight,
     Searching precision find the unavowed
     But vital point. Thy judgment, when allowed
     By the chirurgeon, settles the debate.
     O useful metal!&mdash;were it not for thee
     We'd grapple one another's ears alway:
     But when we hear thee buzzing like a bee
     We, like old Muhlenberg, "care not to stay."
     And when the quick have run away like pullets
     Jack Satan smelts the dead to make new bullets.
</pre>
    <p>
      LEARNING, n. The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious.
    </p>
    <p>
      LECTURER, n. One with his hand in your pocket, his tongue in your ear, and
      his faith in your patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEGACY, n. A gift from one who is legging it out of this vale of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEONINE, adj. Unlike a menagerie lion. Leonine verses are those in which a
      word in the middle rhymes with a word at the end, as in this famous
      passage from Bella Peeler Silcox:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The electric light invades the dunnest deep of
     Hades.
     Cries Pluto, 'twixt his snores: "O tempora! O
     mores!"
</pre>
    <p>
      It should be explained that Mrs. Silcox does not undertake to teach the
      pronunciation of the Greek and Latin tongues. Leonine verses are so called
      in honor of a poet named Leo, whom prosodists appear to find a pleasure in
      believing to have been the first to discover that a rhyming couplet could
      be run into a single line.
    </p>
    <p>
      LETTUCE, n. An herb of the genus <i>Lactuca</i>, "wherewith," says that
      pious gastronome, Hengist Pelly, "God has been pleased to reward the good
      and punish the wicked. For by his inner light the righteous man has
      discerned a manner of compounding for it a dressing to the appetency
      whereof a multitude of gustible condiments conspire, being reconciled and
      ameliorated with profusion of oil, the entire comestible making glad the
      heart of the godly and causing his face to shine. But the person of
      spiritual unworth is successfully tempted of the Adversary to eat of the
      lettuce with destitution of oil, mustard, egg, salt, and garlic, and with
      a rascal bath of vinegar polluted with sugar. Wherefore the person of
      spiritual unworth suffers an intestinal pang of strange complexity and
      raises the song."
    </p>
    <p>
      LEVIATHAN, n. An enormous aquatic animal mentioned by Job. Some suppose it
      to have been the whale, but that distinguished ichthyologer, Dr. Jordan,
      of Stanford University, maintains with considerable heat that it was a
      species of gigantic Tadpole, ('<i>Thaddeus Polandensis</i>) or Polliwig&mdash;
      <i>Maria pseudo-hirsuta</i>. For an exhaustive description and history of
      the Tadpole consult the famous monograph of Jane Porter, <i>Thaddeus of
      Warsaw</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEXICOGRAPHER, n. A pestilent fellow who, under the pretense of recording
      some particular stage in the development of a language, does what he can
      to arrest its growth, stiffen its flexibility, and mechanize its methods.
      For your lexicographer, having written his dictionary, comes to be
      considered "as one having authority," whereas his function is only to make
      a record, not to give a law. The natural servility of the human
      understanding having invested him with judicial power, surrenders its
      right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statute.
      Let the dictionary (for example) mark a good word as "obsolete" or
      "obsolescent" and no man thereafter ventures to use it, whatever his need
      of it and however desirable its restoration to favor&mdash;whereby the
      process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays. On the
      contrary, the bold and discerning writer who, recognizing the truth that
      language must grow by innovation if it grow at all, makes new words and
      uses the old in an unfamiliar sense has no following and is tartly
      reminded that "it is n't in the dictionary"&mdash; although down to the
      time of the first lexicographer (Heaven forgive him!) no author ever had
      used a word that <i>was</i> in the dictionary. In the golden prime and
      high noon of English speech; when from the lips of the great Elizabethans
      fell words that made their own meaning and carried it in their very sound;
      when a Shakespeare and a Bacon were possible, and the language now rapidly
      perishing at one end and slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous
      growth and hardy preservation&mdash;sweeter than honey and stronger than a
      lion&mdash;the lexicographer was a person unknown, the dictionary a
      creation which his Creator had not created him to create.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     God said: "Let Spirit perish into Form,"
     And lexicographers arose, a swarm!
     Thought fled and left her clothing, which they took
     And catalogued each garment in a book.
     Now, from her leafy covert when she cries:
     "Give me my clothes and I 'll return," they rise
     And scan the list, and say without compassion:
     "Excuse us&mdash;they are mostly out of fashion."

      LIAR, n. A lawyer with a roving commission.

      LIBERTY, n. One of Imagination's most precious possessions.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The rising People, hot and out of breath,
     Roared round the palace: "Liberty or death!"
     "If death will do," the King said, "let me reign;
     You 'll have, I 'm sure, no reason to complain."

      LICKSPITTLE, n. A useful functionary, not infrequently found editing a
      newspaper. In his character of editor he is closely allied to the
      blackmailer by the tie of occasional identity; for in truth the
      lickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect, though the
      latter is frequently found as an independent species. Lickspittling is
      more detestable than blackmailing, precisely as the business of a
      confidence man is more detestable than that of a highway robber; and the
      parallel maintains itself throughout, for whereas few robbers will cheat,
      every sneak will plunder if he dare.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIFE, n. A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay. We live in
      daily apprehension of its loss; yet when lost it is not missed. The
      question, "Is life worth living?" has been much discussed; particularly by
      those who think it is not, many of whom have written at great length in
      support of their view and by careful observance of the laws of health
      enjoyed for long terms of years the honors of successful controversy.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Life's not worth living, and that 's the truth,"
     Carelessly caroled the golden youth;
     And in manhood still he maintained that view
     And held it more strongly the older he grew.
     When kicked by a jackass at eighty-three,
     "Go fetch me a surgeon at once!" cried he.

      LIGHTHOUSE, n. A tall building on the seashore in which the government
      maintains a lamp and the friend of a politician.
    </p>
    <p>
      LIMB, n. The branch of a tree or the leg of an American woman.

     'T was a pair of boots that the lady bought.
     And the salesman laced them tight
     To a very remarkable height&mdash;
     Higher, indeed, than I think he ought&mdash;
     Higher than <i>can</i> be right.
     For the Bible declares&mdash;but never mind:
     It is hardly fit
     To censure freely and fault to find
     With others for sins that I 'm not inclined
     Myself to commit.
     Each has his weakness, and though my own
     Is freedom from every sin,
     It still were unfair to pitch in,
     Discharging the first censorious stone.
     Besides, the truth compels me to say,
     The boots in question were <i>made</i> that way.
     As he drew the lace she made a grimace,
     And blushingly said to him:
     "This boot, I 'm sure, is too high to endure,
     It hurts my&mdash;hurts my&mdash;limb."
     The salesman smiled in a manner mild,
     Like an artless, undesigning child;
     Then, checking himself, to his face he gave
     A look as sorrowful as the grave,
     Though he did n't care two figs
     For her pains and throes,
     As he stroked her toes,
     Remarking with speech and manner just
     Befitting his calling: "Madam, I trust
     That it does n't hurt your twigs."

      LITIGANT, n. A person about to give up his skin for the hope of retaining

      LIVER, n. A large red organ thoughtfully provided by nature to be bilious
      with. The sentiments and emotions which every literary anatomist now knows
      to haunt the heart were anciently believed to infest the liver; and even
      Gascoygne, speaking of the emotional side of human nature, calls it "our
      hepaticall parte." It was at one time considered the seat of life; hence
      its name&mdash;liver, the thing we live with. The liver is heaven's best
      gift to the goose; without it that bird would be unable to supply us with
      the Strasbourg <i>pâté</i>.

      LL.D. Letters indicating the degree <i>Legumptionis Doctor</i>, one
      learned in the laws, gifted with legal gumption. Some suspicion is cast
      upon this derivation by the fact that the title was formerly <i>££. d.</i>
      and conferred only upon gentlemen distinguished for their wealth. At the
      date of this writing Columbia University is considering the expediency of
      making another degree for clergymen, in place of the old D.D.&mdash;<i>Damnator
      Diaboli</i>. The new honor will be known as <i>Sanctorum Custos</i>, and
      written $$. c. The name of the Rev. John Satan has been suggested as a
      suitable recipient by a lover of consistency, who points out that
      Professor Harry Thurston Peck has long enjoyed the advantage of a degree.

      LOCK-AND-KEY, n. The distinguishing device of civilization and

      newspaper Trinity, the Roomer, the Bedder, and the Mealer.

    <p>
      LOGIC, n. The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the
      limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding. The basis of
      logic is the syllogism, consisting of a major and a minor premise and a
      conclusion&mdash;thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Major Premise</i>: Sixty men can do a piece of work sixty times as
      quickly as one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Minor Premise</i>: One man can dig a post-hole in sixty seconds;
      therefore&mdash; <i>Conclusion</i>: Sixty men can dig a post-hole in
      one second.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may be called the syllogism arithmetical, in which, by combining
      logic and mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are twice blessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD, n. In American society, an English tourist above the state of a
      costermonger, as, Lord 'Aberdasher, Lord Hartisan, and so forth. The
      travelling Briton of lesser degree is addressed as "Sir," as, Sir 'Arry
      Donkiboi, of 'Amstead 'Eath. The word "Lord" is sometimes used, also, as a
      title of the Supreme Being; but this is thought to be rather flattery than
      true reverence.

     Miss Sallie Ann Splurge, of her own accord,
     Wedded a wandering English lord&mdash;
     Wedded and took him to dwell with her "paw,"
     A parent who throve by the practice of Draw.
     Lord Cadde I don't hesitate here to declare
     Unworthy the father-in-legal care
     Of that elderly sport, notwithstanding the truth
     That Cadde had renounced the follies of youth;
     For, sad to relate, he 'd arrived at the stage
     Of existence that 's marked by the vices of age.
     Among them cupidity caused him to urge
     Repeated demands on the pocket of Splurge,
     Till, wrecked in his fortune, that gentleman saw
     Inadequate aid in the practice of Draw,
     And took, as a means of augmenting his pelf,
     To the business of being a lord himself.
     His neat-fitting garments he willfully shed
     And sacked himself strangely in checks instead;
     Denuded his chin, but retained at each ear
     A whisker that looked like a blasted career.

     He painted his neck an incarnadine hue
     Each morning and varnished it all that he knew.
     The moony monocular set in his eye
     Appeared to be scanning the Sweet Bye-and-Bye.
     His head was enroofed with a billycock hat,
     And his low-necked shoes were aduncous and flat.
     In speech he eschewed his American ways,
     Denying his nose to the use of his A's
     And dulling their edge till the delicate sense
     Of a babe at their temper could take no offence.
     His H's&mdash;'t was most inexpressibly sweet,
     The patter they made as they fell at his feet!
     Re-outfitted thus, Mr. Splurge without fear
     Began as Lord Splurge his recouping career.

     Alas, the Divinity shaping his end
     Entertained other views and decided to send
     His lordship in horror, despair, and dismay
     From the land of the nobleman's natural prey.

     For, smit with his Old World ways, Lady Cadde
     Fell&mdash;suffering Caesar!&mdash;in love with her dad!
